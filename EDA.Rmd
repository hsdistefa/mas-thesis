```{r setup}
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "C:/Users/harrison/Dropbox/Schoolwork/Thesis/Project/")
```


```{r load data}
housing_data <- read.csv('data/processed.csv')
head(housing_data)
```


```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
